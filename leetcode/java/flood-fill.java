 * 733. Flood Fill
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/
 *
 * You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image,
 * where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also
 * given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood
 * fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
 *
 * To perform a flood fill:
 *   1. Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
 *   2. Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent
 *      (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either
 *      horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the
 *      starting pixel.
 *   3. Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the
 *      updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original
 *      color of the starting pixel.
 *   4. The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the
 *      original color to update.
 *
 * Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input:  image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
 *   Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
 *   Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) =
 *   (1, 1), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the
 *   starting pixel are colored with the new color. The bottom corner is
 *   not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected
 *   to the starting pixel.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input:  image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
 *   Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
 *   Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes
 *   are made to the image.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - m == image.length
 *   - n == image[i].length
 *   - 1 <= m, n <= 50
 *   - 0 <= image[i][j], color < 2^16
 *   - 0 <= sr < m
 *   - 0 <= sc < n
