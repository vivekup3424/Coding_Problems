 * 1267. Count Servers that Communicate
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-servers-that-communicate/
 *
 * You are given a map of a server center, represented as an m x n integer
 * matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0
 * means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they
 * are on the same row or on the same column.
 *
 * Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input:  grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input:  grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation: All three servers can communicate with at least one other
 *   server.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input:  grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation: The two servers in the first row can communicate with
 *   each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with
 *   each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with
 *   any other server.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - m == grid.length
 *   - n == grid[i].length
 *   - 1 <= m <= 250
 *   - 1 <= n <= 250
 *   - grid[i][j] == 0 or 1
