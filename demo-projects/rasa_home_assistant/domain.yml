        I'm your smart home assistant! Here's what I can do:

        🏠 **Quick Commands:**
        • "Good morning" / "Good night" 
        • "I'm leaving" / "I'm home"
        • "Movie time" / "Work mode"
        • "Turn everything off"

        💡 **Scene Control:**
        • "Turn on living room lights"
        • "Set relax mode in bedroom"
        • "Execute scene 123 in kitchen"

        📋 **Information:**
        • "Show me all scenes"
        • "What rooms can I control?"

        Just tell me what you want naturally - I'll ask if I need more details!

  utter_ask_which_room:
    - text: "Which room would you like me to control? 🏠"
    - text: "In which room should I do that? I can control multiple rooms."
    - text: "What room are we talking about? Say 'all rooms' if you want everywhere."

  utter_ask_which_scene:
    - text: "What scene would you like me to set? You can say things like 'bright', 'relax', or 'night mode'."
    - text: "Which scene should I activate? I have options like bright, relax, night, and all off."
    - text: "What lighting mood are you looking for? Try 'bright', 'dim', 'relax', or tell me the scene name."

  utter_ask_scene_details:
    - text: "I need a bit more information. Which scene and which room? 🤔"
    - text: "Could you be more specific? What scene would you like and in which room?"
    - text: "I want to help! Can you tell me the scene name and room?"

  utter_scene_executed:
    - text: "✅ Done! Your scene is now active."
    - text: "✅ Perfect! The scene has been set."
    - text: "✅ All set! Your lighting is now configured."

  utter_scene_error:
    - text: "❌ Sorry, I couldn't execute that scene. Please try again or ask for help."
    - text: "❌ Something went wrong. Could you try rephrasing your request?"
    - text: "❌ I'm having trouble with that. Can you check the scene name and room?"

  utter_clarify_room:
    - text: "I found that scene in multiple rooms: {rooms}. Which room did you mean?"
    - text: "That scene is available in: {rooms}. Please specify which room."
    - text: "I see that scene in {rooms}. Which one would you like?"

  utter_scene_not_found:
    - text: "I couldn't find that scene. Would you like to see all available scenes?"
    - text: "That scene doesn't exist. Say 'show scenes' to see what's available."
    - text: "I don't recognize that scene name. Try 'list scenes' to see your options."

  utter_default:
    - text: "I'm not sure I understand. Could you try rephrasing? Or say 'help' for examples! 🤔"
    - text: "Hmm, I didn't catch that. Try saying something like 'turn on living room lights' or ask for help!"
    - text: "I'm a bit confused. Can you try a different way? Or ask me what I can do!"
