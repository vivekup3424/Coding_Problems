        I'm your smart home assistant! Here's what I can do:

        Scene Control:
        • "Turn on living room lights"
        • "Set relax mode in bedroom"
        • "Execute scene 123 in kitchen"

        Information
        • "Show me all scenes"

        Just tell me what you want!

    - text: "In which room should I do that?"
    - text: "What room are we talking about?"

  utter_ask_which_scene:

    - text: "Which scene should I activate? I have options like bright, relax, night, and all off."
    - text: "What lighting mood are you looking for? Try 'bright', 'dim', 'relax', or tell me the scene name."

  utter_ask_scene_details:
    - text: "I need a bit more information. Which scene and which room?"
    - text: "Could you be more specific? What scene would you like and in which room?"
