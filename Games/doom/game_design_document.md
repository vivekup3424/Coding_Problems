# 2D Doom Platformer - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A side-scrolling 2D platformer that captures the essence of Doom - fast-paced action, demon slaying, and arsenal of iconic weapons, but adapted to platformer mechanics.

## Game Mechanics

### Movement & Combat
- **Player Movement**: Run, double jump, dash/dodge
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Aim in 8 directions while moving (similar to Contra or Metal Slug)
- **Weapon Switching**: Quick weapon wheel or cycling through weapons
- **Glory Kills**: Close-range execution moves on stunned enemies for health/ammo

### Weapons
1. **Pistol**: Unlimited ammo, basic weapon
2. **Shotgun**: Powerful short-range weapon, slower fire rate
3. **Plasma Rifle**: Rapid fire energy weapon
4. **Rocket Launcher**: Explosive area damage, can cause self-damage
5. **BFG**: Screen-clearing super weapon with limited ammo

### Enemies
1. **Imps**: Basic enemies, throw fireballs
2. **Pinkies**: Fast charging enemies
3. **Cacodemons**: Floating enemies that spit projectiles
4. **Hell Knights**: Mini-boss type enemies with jump attacks
5. **Cyberdemon**: Level boss with rocket attacks

## Level Design

### Structure
- **Multiple Levels**: Each with increasing difficulty
- **Secret Areas**: Hidden rooms with power-ups and extra lives
- **Environmental Hazards**: Lava pits, acid pools, crushing platforms

### Visual Style
- **Pixel Art**: 16-bit style reminiscent of SNES/Genesis era
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Despite 2D perspective, incorporate dynamic lighting effects
- **Gore System**: Satisfying enemy deaths with pixelated gore effects

## Progression System
- **Weapon Upgrades**: Collect mods to enhance weapons
- **Runes**: Special abilities that can be equipped (double jump, faster reload, etc.)
- **Praetor Suit Points**: Upgrade health, armor, and ammo capacity

## Audio Design
- **Music**: Fast-paced metal tracks inspired by Doom's soundtrack
- **Sound Effects**: Faithful adaptations of classic Doom sounds

## Technical Considerations
- **Engine Options**: Unity, Godot, or GameMaker Studio
- **Target Platforms**: PC initially, potential for console/mobile ports
- **Performance**: Aim for 60fps even with many sprites on screen

## Art Style Reference Games
- Blasphemous (for gothic horror elements)
- Carrion (for fluid movement and gore)
- Dead Cells (for weapon variety and combat flow)

## Questions for Discussion
1. How closely should we follow Doom's story?
2. Should we include multiplayer features?
3. Are there specific Doom elements that must be preserved?
4. What's the target audience age rating?
