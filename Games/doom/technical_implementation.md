# Technical Implementation Plan - 2D Doom Platformer

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Game Engine Options
1. **Unity**
   - Pros: Robust 2D tools, large community, good performance
   - Cons: More complex for simple 2D games, licensing considerations
   
2. **Godot**
   - Pros: Free and open source, excellent for 2D, lightweight
   - Cons: Smaller community than Unity, fewer plugins
   
3. **GameMaker Studio**
   - Pros: Designed specifically for 2D games, easy to learn
   - Cons: Less powerful for complex systems, licensing costs

**Recommendation**: Godot Engine (version 4.0+) for its free licensing, strong 2D capabilities, and growing community support

## Core Systems Implementation

### Player Controller
```gdscript
# Example Godot implementation concept
extends KinematicBody2D

var velocity = Vector2()
var speed = 300
var jump_force = 600
var gravity = 1200
var can_double_jump = true

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Horizontal movement
    var direction = Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")
    velocity.x = direction * speed
    
    # Jumping logic
    if is_on_floor():
        can_double_jump = true
        if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump"):
            velocity.y = -jump_force
    elif can_double_jump and Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump"):
        velocity.y = -jump_force
        can_double_jump = false
    
    # Apply gravity
    velocity.y += gravity * delta
    
    # Move the character
    velocity = move_and_slide(velocity, Vector2.UP)
    
    # Weapon handling
    handle_weapons()

func handle_weapons():
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("weapon_next"):
        cycle_weapon(1)
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("weapon_prev"):
        cycle_weapon(-1)
    if Input.is_action_pressed("shoot"):
        current_weapon.shoot()
```

### Weapon System
- Component-based design
- Base weapon class with specialized child classes
- Projectile pooling for performance

### Enemy AI
- State machine implementation
- Pathfinding for ground enemies
- Line-of-sight detection
- Difficulty scaling

## Game Architecture

### Scene Structure
```

```

### Save System
- JSON-based save files
- Auto-save at checkpoints
- Multiple save slots

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
1. Object pooling for projectiles and particles
2. Sprite atlasing for reduced draw calls
3. Enemy and effect culling when off-screen
4. Level streaming for larger levels

### Target Specifications
- 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- <100MB total game size
- Support for gamepad and keyboard/mouse

## Testing Framework

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for core game mechanics
- Performance benchmarks for critical systems
- AI behavior tests

### Playtesting Plan
1. Internal developer testing
2. Closed alpha with limited testers
3. Open beta for gameplay feedback
4. Final polish based on feedback
