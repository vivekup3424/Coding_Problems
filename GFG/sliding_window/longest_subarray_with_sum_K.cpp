/*
Given an array containing N positive integers and an integer K. 
Your task is to find the length of the longest Sub-Array with 
sum of the elements equal to the given value K.*/

//N - no of elements
//K - given sum

/*
Efficient Approach:-
Initialize sum = 0 and maxLen = 0
Create a hashtable having (sum,index) as tuples
