# Knowledge Graph Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating various knowledge graph concepts and operations.

## Scripts

1. **`basic_operations.py`** - Basic CRUD operations
2. **`graph_analysis.py`** - Graph analysis and metrics
3. **`recommendation_system.py`** - Simple recommendation engine
4. **`data_import.py`** - Import data from external sources
5. **`visualization_examples.py`** - Various visualization techniques

## Running Examples

Make sure you have Neo4j running (via Docker or locally) and run:

```bash
# Setup the database first
python main.py setup

# Generate sample data
python main.py generate

# Run specific examples
python examples/basic_operations.py
python examples/graph_analysis.py
python examples/recommendation_system.py
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with `basic_operations.py` to understand fundamental operations
2. Move to `graph_analysis.py` for analytical techniques
3. Explore `recommendation_system.py` for practical applications
4. Try `visualization_examples.py` for different ways to visualize data
5. Use `data_import.py` to work with real datasets
